This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function. When using relative units like percentages within `calc()`, it's crucial to ensure that the parent element has explicitly defined dimensions. Otherwise, the calculation may not produce the expected results, leading to layout inconsistencies.  The `bug.css` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version.
