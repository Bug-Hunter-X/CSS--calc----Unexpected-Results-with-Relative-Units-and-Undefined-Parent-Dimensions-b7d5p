The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, using it with percentages or other units that are relative to the containing element may produce unexpected results if the containing element does not have explicitly defined dimensions.  For example:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
}
```

If the parent element of `.element` does not have a defined width, the calculation will fail because `50%` cannot be determined.
